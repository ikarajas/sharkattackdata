<p>
  Welcome to Shark Attack Data. The aim of this website is to increase
  understanding, and promote an informed discussion on the subject of
  shark attacks; when, where and how they occur. Through visualisation
  of the data, it aims to help identify where patterns exist in terms
  of both geography and time.
</p>

<p>
  All of the data on this site comes from
  the <a href="http://www.sharkattackfile.net/">Global Shark Attack
  File (GSAF)</a>, a spreadsheet of human/shark interactions, compiled
  by the <a href="http://www.sharks.org/">Shark Attack Research
  Institute</a>. It is hoped that this site makes it apparent that
  shark attacks are extremely rare occurrences, while providing an
  easily accessible resource for those wishing to know more about the
  subject.

<p>
  Currently, shark attacks are grouped by country and then, within
  each country, the area in which attacks have occurred. We are
  currently investigating other ways to allow the data to be browsed
  and queried. Suggestions are welcome; if you have one,
  please <a href="mailto:contact@sharkattackdata.com?Subject=[SharkAttackData]"
